This is a quite old but maybe useful wiki for this library.

# Converting your 2.x program to the 3.x version
- Now there is  an **IRreceiver** and **IRsender** object like the well known Arduino **Serial** object.
- Just remove the line `IRrecv IrReceiver(IR_RECEIVE_PIN);` and/or `IRsend IrSender;` in your program, and replace all occurrences of `IRrecv.` or `irrecv.` with `IrReceiver`.
- Since the decoded values are now in `IrReceiver.decodedIRData` and not in `results` any more, remove the line `decode_results results` or similar.
- Like for the Serial object, call [`IrReceiver.begin(IR_RECEIVE_PIN, ENABLE_LED_FEEDBACK);`](https://github.com/Arduino-IRremote/Arduino-IRremote/blob/master/examples/IRreceiveDemo/IRreceiveDemo.ino#L38) or `IrReceiver.begin(IR_RECEIVE_PIN, DISABLE_LED_FEEDBACK);` instead of the `IrReceiver.enableIRIn();` or `irrecv.enableIRIn();` in setup().
- Old `decode(decode_results *aResults)` function is replaced by simple `decode()`. So if you have a statement `if(irrecv.decode(&results))` replace it with `if (IrReceiver.decode())`.
- The decoded result is now in in `IrReceiver.decodedIRData` and not in `results` any more, therefore replace any occurrences of `results.value`  and / or `results.decode_type` (and similar) to `IrReceiver.decodedIRData.decodedRawData` and / or `IrReceiver.decodedIRData.decodedRawData`.
- Overflow, Repeat and other flags are now in [`IrReceiver.receivedIRData.flags`](https://github.com/Arduino-IRremote/Arduino-IRremote/blob/master/src/IRremote.h#L126).
- Seldom used: `results.rawbuf` and `results.rawlen` must be replaced by `IrReceiver.decodedIRData.rawDataPtr->rawbuf` and `IrReceiver.decodedIRData.rawDataPtr->rawlen`.
- The old functions `sendNEC()` and `sendJVC()` are deprecated and renamed to `sendNECMSB()` and `sendJVCMSB()` to make it clearer that they send data with MSB first, which is not the standard for NEC and JVC. Use them to send your **old 32 bit IR data codes**.
In the new version you will send NEC commands not by 32 bit codes but by a (constant) 8 bit address and an 8 bit command.

# FAQ
- IR does not work right when I use Neopixels (aka WS2811/WS2812/WS2812B)<br/>
 Whether you use the Adafruit Neopixel lib, or FastLED, interrupts get disabled on many lower end CPUs like the basic Arduinos for longer than 50 Âµs.
In turn, this stops the IR interrupt handler from running when it needs to. There are some solutions to this on some processors,
 [see this page from Marc MERLIN](http://marc.merlins.org/perso/arduino/post_2017-04-03_Arduino-328P-Uno-Teensy3_1-ESP8266-ESP32-IR-and-Neopixels.html)
- The default IR timer on AVR's is timer 2. Since the **Arduino Tone library** as well as **analogWrite() for pin 3 and pin 11** requires timer 2,
 this functionality cannot be used simultaneously. You can use tone() but after the tone has stopped, you must call IrReceiver.enableIRIn() to restore the timer settings for receive.<br/>
If you can live with the NEC protocol, you can try the MinimalReceiver example, it requires no timer.
- You can use **multiple IR receiver** by just connecting the output pins of several IR receivers together.
 The IR receivers use an NPN transistor as output device with just a 30k resistor to VCC.
 This is almost "open collector" and allows connecting of several output pins to one Arduino input pin.

# Minimal version
For applications only requiring NEC protocol, there is a receiver which has very **small codesize and does NOT require any timer**. See the MinimalReceiver and IRDispatcherDemo example how to use it.

# Handling unknown Protocols
## Disclaimer
This library was never designed to handle long codes like the ones used by air conditioners.
See [Recording long Infrared Remote control signals with Arduino](https://www.analysir.com/blog/2014/03/19/air-conditioners-problems-recording-long-infrared-remote-control-signals-arduino).<br/>
The main reason is, that it was designed to fit inside MCUs with relatively low levels of resources and was intended to work as a library together with other applications which also require some resources of the MCU to operate.

## Hints
If you do not know which protocol your IR transmitter uses, you have several choices.
- Use the [IRreceiveDump example](examples/IRreceiveDump) to dump out the IR timing.
 You can then reproduce/send this timing with the [IRsendRawDemo example](examples/IRsendRawDemo).
 For **long codes** with more than 48 bits like from air conditioners, you can **change the length of the input buffer** in [IRremote.h](src/IRremote.h#L27).
- The [IRMP AllProtocol example](https://github.com/ukw100/IRMP#allprotocol-example) prints the protocol and data for one of the **40 supported protocols**.
 The same library can be used to send this codes.
- If you have a bigger Arduino board at hand (> 100 kByte program space) you can try the
 [IRremoteDecode example](https://github.com/bengtmartensson/Arduino-DecodeIR/blob/master/examples/IRremoteDecode/IRremoteDecode.ino) of the Arduino library [DecodeIR](https://github.com/bengtmartensson/Arduino-DecodeIR).
- Use [IrScrutinizer](http://www.harctoolbox.org/IrScrutinizer.html).
 It can automatically generate a send sketch for your protocol by exporting as "Arduino Raw". It supports IRremote,
 the old [IRLib](https://github.com/cyborg5/IRLib) and [Infrared4Arduino](https://github.com/bengtmartensson/Infrared4Arduino).
- To **increase strength of sent output signal** you can increase the current through the send diode, or use 2 diodes in series,
 since one IR diode requires only 1.5 volt. Changing `IR_SEND_DUTY_CYCLE` to 50 increases the signal current by 40%.

# Compile options / macros for this library
To customize the library to different requirements, there are some compile options / macros available.<br/>
Modify it by commenting them out or in, or change the values if applicable. Or define the macro with the -D compiler option for global compile (the latter is not possible with the Arduino IDE, so consider using [Sloeber](https://eclipse.baeyens.it).

| Name | File | Default value | Description |
|-|-|-|-|
| `EXCLUDE_EXOTIC_PROTOCOLS` | Before `#include <IRremote.h>` | disabled | If activated, BOSEWAVE, MAGIQUEST,WHYNTER and LEGO_PF are excluded in `decode()` and in sending with `IrSender.write()`. Saves up to 900 bytes program space. |
| `MARK_EXCESS_MICROS` | Before `#include <IRremote.h>` | 20 | MARK_EXCESS_MICROS is subtracted from all marks and added to all spaces before decoding, to compensate for the signal forming of different IR receiver modules. |
| `IR_INPUT_IS_ACTIVE_HIGH` | IRremoteInt.h | disabled | Enable it if you use a RF receiver, which has an active HIGH output signal. |
| `DEBUG` | IRremote1.h | disabled | Enables lots of lovely debug output. |
| `USE_NO_SEND_PWM` | IRremote.h | disabled | Use no carrier PWM, just simulate an active low receiver signal. |
| `USE_SOFT_SEND_PWM` | IRremote.h | disabled | Use carrier PWM generation in software, instead of hardware PWM. |
| `PULSE_CORRECTION_MICROS` | IRremote.h | 3 | If USE_SOFT_SEND_PWM, this amount is subtracted from the on-time of the pulses. |
| `USE_SPIN_WAIT` | IRremote.h | disabled | If USE_SOFT_SEND_PWM, use spin wait instead of delayMicros(). |
| `SUPPORT_SEND_EXOTIC_PROTOCOLS` | IRremote.h | enabled | If activated, BOSEWAVE and LEGO_PF are supported in the write method. Costs around 500 bytes program space. |
| `RAW_BUFFER_LENGTH` | IRremoteint.h | 101 | Buffer size of raw input buffer. Must be odd! |
| `IR_SEND_DUTY_CYCLE` | IRremoteBoardDefs.h | 30 | Duty cycle of IR send signal. |
| `MICROS_PER_TICK` | IRremoteBoardDefs.h | 50 | Resolution of the raw input buffer data. |
| `USE_CUSTOM_DELAY` | irSend.cpp | disabled | Use old custom_delay_usec() function for mark and space delays. |
|-|-|-|-|
| `IR_INPUT_PIN` | TinyIRReceiver.h | 2 | The pin number for TinyIRReceiver IR input, which gets compiled in. |
| `IR_FEEDBACK_LED_PIN` | TinyIRReceiver.h | `LED_BUILTIN` | The pin number for TinyIRReceiver feedback LED, which gets compiled in. |
| `DO_NOT_USE_FEEDBACK_LED` | TinyIRReceiver.h | disabled | Enable it to disable the feedback LED function. |



### Modifying compile options with Arduino IDE
First use *Sketch > Show Sketch Folder (Ctrl+K)*.<br/>
If you did not yet stored the example as your own sketch, then you are instantly in the right library folder.<br/>
Otherwise you have to navigate to the parallel `libraries` folder and select the library you want to access.<br/>
In both cases the library files itself are located in the `src` directory.<br/>

### Modifying compile options with Sloeber IDE
If you are using Sloeber as your IDE, you can easily define global symbols with *Properties > Arduino > CompileOptions*.<br/>

We are open to suggestions for adding support to new boards, however we highly recommend you contact your supplier first and ask them to provide support from their side.

## Hardware specifications
The receiver sample interval is generated by a timer. 
On many boards this must be a hardware timer, on some a software timer is available and used.<br/>
The send PWM signal is generated by a hardware timer. The same timer as for the receiver is used.
Since each hardware timer has its dedicated output pins, you must change timer to change PWN output.<br/>
The timer and the pin usage can be adjusted in [IRremoteBoardDefs.h](src/private/IRremoteBoardDefs.h)

# Adding new protocols
To add a new protocol is quite straightforward. Best is too look at the existing protocols to find a similar one and modify it.<br/>
As a rule of thumb, it is easier to work with a description of the protocol rather than trying to entirely reverse-engineer the protocol.
Please include a link to the description in the header, if you found one.<br/>
The **durations** you receive are likely to be longer for marks and shorter for spaces than the protocol suggests,
but this depends on the receiver circuit in use. Most protocols use multiples of one time-unit for marks and spaces like e.g. [NEC](https://github.com/Arduino-IRremote/Arduino-IRremote/blob/master/src/ir_NEC.cpp#L50). It's easy to be off-by-one with the last bit, since the last space is not recorded by IRremote.

Try to make use of the template functions `decodePulseDistanceData()` and `sendPulseDistanceData()`.
If your protocol supports address and code fields, try to reflect this in your api like it is done in [`sendNEC(uint16_t aAddress, uint8_t aCommand, uint8_t aNumberOfRepeats, bool aIsRepeat)`](https://github.com/z3t0/Arduino-IRremote/blob/master/src/ir_NEC.cpp#L86) and [`decodeNEC()`](https://github.com/z3t0/Arduino-IRremote/blob/master/src/ir_NEC.cpp#L145).<br/>

### Integration
To integrate your protocol, you need to extend the two functions `decode()` and `getProtocolString()` in *IRreceice.cpp*,
add macros and function declarations for sending and receiving and extend the `enum decode_type_t` in *IRremote.h*.<br/>
And at least it would be wonderful if you can provide an example how to use the new protocol.
A detailed description can be found in the [ir_Template.cpp](https://github.com/z3t0/Arduino-IRremote/blob/master/src/ir_Template.cpp#L18) file.

# Revision History
Please see [changelog.md](https://github.com/z3t0/Arduino-IRremote/blob/master/changelog.md).

# API documentation
See [API reference in wiki](https://github.com/z3t0/Arduino-IRremote/wiki/API-Reference).

To generate the API documentation,
Doxygen, as well as [Graphviz](http://www.graphviz.org/) should be installed.
(Note that on Windows, it may be necessary to add the Graphviz binary directory
(something like `C:\Program Files\Graphviz2.38\bin`)
to the `PATH` variable manually.)
With Doxygen and Graphviz installed, issue the command
`doxygen` from the command line in the main project directory, which will
generate the API documentation in HTML format.
The just generated `api-doc/index.html` can now be opened in a browser.

## Why do we use 33% duty cycle
We do it according to the statement in the [Vishay datasheet](https://www.vishay.com/docs/80069/circuit.pdf):
- Carrier duty cycle 50 %, peak current of emitter IF = 200 mA, the resulting transmission distance is 25 m.
- Carrier duty cycle 10 %, peak current of emitter IF = 800 mA, the resulting transmission distance is 29 m. - Factor 1.16
The reason is, that it is not the pure energy of the fundamental which is responsible for the receiver to detect a signal.
Due to automatic gain control and other bias effects high intensity and lower energy (duty cycle) of the 38 kHz pulse counts more than high low intensity and higher energy.

BTW, **the best way to increase the IR power** is to use 2 or 3 IR diodes in series. One diode requires 1.1 to 1.5 volt so you can supply 3 diodes with a 5 volt output.<br/>
To keep the current, you must reduce the resistor by (5 - 1.3) / (5 - 2.6) = 1.5 e.g. from 150 ohm to 100 ohm for 25 mA and 2 diodes with 1.3 volt and a 5 volt supply.<br/>
For 3 diodes it requires factor 2.5 e.g. from 150 ohm to 60 ohm.
