/*
 Assuming the protocol we are adding is for the (imaginary) manufacturer:  Shuzu

 Our fantasy protocol is a standard protocol, so we can use this standard
 template without too much work. Some protocols are quite unique and will require
 considerably more work in this file! It is way beyond the scope of this text to
 explain how to reverse engineer "unusual" IR protocols. But, unless you own an
 oscilloscope, the starting point is probably to use the rawDump.ino sketch and
 try to spot the pattern!

 Before you start, make sure the IR library is working OK:
 # Open up the Arduino IDE
 # Load up the rawDump.ino example sketch
 # Run it

 Now we can start to add our new protocol...

 1. Copy this file to : ir_Shuzu.cpp

 2. Replace all occurrences of "Shuzu" with the name of your protocol.

 3. Tweak the #defines to suit your protocol.

 4. If you're lucky, tweaking the #defines will make the default send() function
 work.

 5. Again, if you're lucky, tweaking the #defines will have made the default
 decode() function work.

 You have written the code to support your new protocol!

 Now you must do a few things to add it to the IRremote system:

 1. Open IRremote.h and make the following changes:
 REMEMBER to change occurrences of "SHUZU" with the name of your protocol

 A. At the top, in the section "Supported Protocols", add:
 #define DECODE_SHUZU  1
 #define SEND_SHUZU    1

 B. In the section "An enum consisting of all supported formats", add:
 SHUZU,
 to the end of the list (notice there is a comma after the protocol name)

 C. Further down in "Main class for receiving IR", add:
 //......................................................................
 #if DECODE_SHUZU
 bool  decodeShuzu () ;
 #endif

 D. Further down in "Main class for sending IR", add:
 //......................................................................
 #if SEND_SHUZU
 void  sendShuzuStandard (uint16_t aAddress, uint8_t aCommand, uint8_t aNumberOfRepeats) ;
 #endif

 E. Save your changes and close the file

 2. Now open irReceive.cpp and make the following change:

 A. In the function IRrecv::decode(), add:
 #ifdef DECODE_SHUZU
 DBG_PRINTLN("Attempting Shuzu decode");
 if (decodeShuzu())  return true ;
 #endif

 B. In the function IRrecv::getProtocolString(), add
 #if DECODE_SHUZU
 case SHUZU:
 return ("Shuzu");
 break;
 #endif

 C. Save your changes and close the file

 Now open the Arduino IDE, load up the rawDump.ino sketch, and run it.
 Hopefully it will compile and upload.
 If it doesn't, you've done something wrong. Check your work.
 If you can't get it to work - seek help from somewhere.

 If you get this far, I will assume you have successfully added your new protocol
 There is one last thing to do.

 1. Delete this giant instructional comment.

 2. Send a copy of your work to us so we can include it in the library and
 others may benefit from your hard work and maybe even write a song about how
 great you are for helping them! :)

 Regards,
 BlueChip
