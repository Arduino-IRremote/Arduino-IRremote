## 2.8.2 2020/11
- Added SendRaw with byte data.
- Fixed resume bug if irparams.rawlen >= RAW_BUFFER_LENGTH. Thanks to Iosif Peterfi

## 2.8.1 2020/10
- Fixed bug in Sony decode introduced in 2.8.0.

## 2.8.0 2020/10
- Changed License to MIT see https://github.com/z3t0/Arduino-IRremote/issues/397.
- Added ATtiny timer 1 support.
- Changed wrong return code signature of decodePulseDistanceData() and its handling.
- Removed Mitsubishi protocol, since the implementation is in contradiction with all documentation I could found and therefore supposed to be wrong.
- Removed AIWA implementation, since it is only for 1 device and at least sending implemented wrong.
- Added Lego_PF decode.
- Added new example IR2Keyboard.
- Changed internal usage of custom_delay_usec.
- Moved dump/print functions from example to irReceiver.
- irPronto.cpp: Using Print instead of Stream saves 1020 bytes program memory. Changed from & to * parameter type to be more transparent and consistent with other code of IRremote.

## 2.7.0 2020/09
- Added ATmega328PB support.
- Renamed hardware specific macro and function names.
- Renamed `USE_SOFT_CARRIER`, `USE_NO_CARRIER`, `DUTY_CYCLE` macros to `USE_SOFT_SEND_PWM`, `USE_NO_SEND_PWM`, `IR_SEND_DUTY_CYCLE`.
- Removed blocking wait for ATmega32U4 Serial in examples.
- Deactivated default debug output.
- Optimized types in sendRC5ext and sendSharpAlt.
- Added `DECODE_NEC_STANDARD` and `SEND_NEC_STANDARD`.
- Renamed all IRrecv* examples to IRreceive*.
- Added functions `printResultShort(&Serial)` and `getProtocolString(decode_type_t aDecodeType)`.
- Added flag `results.isRepeat`.
- Updated examples.

## 2.6.1 2020/08
- Adjusted JVC and LG timing.
- Fixed 4809 bug.

## 2.6.0 2020/08
- Added support for MagiQuest IR wands.
- Corrected Samsung timing.
- NEC repeat implementation.
- Formatting and changing `TIMER_CONFIG_KHZ` and `TIMER_CONFIG_NORMAL` macros to static functions.
- Added `IRAM_ATTR` for ESP32 ISR.
- Removed #define `HAS_AVR_INTERRUPT_H`.
- Changed Receiver States. Now starting with 0.
- Changed switch to if / else if in IRRemote.cpp because of ESP32 compiler bug.
- Changed `DEBUG` handling since compiler warns about empty "IF" or "ELSE" statements in IRRemote.cpp.

## 2.5.0 2020/06
- Corrected keywords.txt.
- BoseWave protocol added PR #690.
- Formatting comply to the new stylesheet.
- Renamed "boarddefs.h" [ISSUE #375](https://github.com/z3t0/Arduino-IRremote/issues/375).
- Renamed `SEND_PIN` to `IR_SEND_PIN`.
- Renamed state macros.
- Enabled `DUTY_CYCLE` for send signal.
- Added sending for ESP32.
- Changed rawlen from uint8_t to unsigned int allowing bigger receive buffer and renamed `RAWBUF` to `RAW_BUFFER_LENGTH`.
- Introduced `USE_NO_CARRIER` for simulating an IR receiver.
Changes from #283 by bengtmartensson
- Added function sendRaw_P() for sending data from flash.
Changes from #268 by adamlhumphreys
- Optimized by reducing floating point operations as suggested by @madmalkav (#193).
- Optimized with macros when using default `MICROS_PER_TICK` and `TOLERANCE`.
