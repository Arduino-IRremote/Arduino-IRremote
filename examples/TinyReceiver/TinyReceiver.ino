/*
 *  TinyReceiver.cpp
 *
 *  Small memory footprint and no timer usage!
 *
 *  Receives IR protocol data of NEC protocol using pin change interrupts.
 *  On complete received IR command the function handleReceivedIRData(uint16_t aAddress, uint8_t aCommand, uint8_t aFlags)
 *  is called in Interrupt context but with interrupts being enabled to enable use of delay() etc.
 *  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
 *  Functions called in interrupt context should be running as short as possible,
 *  so if you require longer action, save the data (address + command) and handle it in the main loop.
 *  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
 *
 * The FAST protocol is a proprietary modified JVC protocol without address, with parity and with a shorter header.
 *  FAST Protocol characteristics:
 * - Bit timing is like NEC or JVC
 * - The header is shorter, 3156 vs. 12500
 * - No address and 16 bit data, interpreted as 8 bit command and 8 bit inverted command,
 *     leading to a fixed protocol length of (6 + (16 * 3) + 1) * 526 = 55 * 526 = 28930 microseconds or 29 ms.
 * - Repeats are sent as complete frames but in a 50 ms period / with a 21 ms distance.
