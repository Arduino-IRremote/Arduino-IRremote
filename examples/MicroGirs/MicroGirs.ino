/**
 * @file MicroGirs.ino
 *
 * @brief This is a minimalistic <a href="http://harctoolbox.org/Girs.html">Girs server</a>.
 * It only depends on (a subset of) IRremote. It can be used with
 * <a href="http://www.harctoolbox.org/IrScrutinizer.html">IrScrutinizer</a>
 * (select Sending/Capturing hw = Girs Client) as well as
 * <a href="http://lirc.org">Lirc</a>
 * version  0.9.4 and later, using the driver <a href="http://lirc.org/html/girs.html">Girs</a>).
 * (Authors of similar software are encourage to implement support.)
 *
 * It runs on all hardware on which IRemote runs.
 *
 * It consists of an interactive IR server, taking one-line commands from
 * the "user" (which is typically not a person but another program), and
 * responds with a one-line response. In the language of the Girs
 * specifications, the modules "base", receive, and transmit are
 * implemented. (The two latter can be disabled by not defining two
 * corresponding CPP symbols.)
 *
 * It understands the following commands:
 *
 * The "version" command returns the program name and version,
 * The "modules" command returns the modules implemented, normally base, receive and transmit.
 * The "receive" command reads an IR signal using the used, demodulating IR sensor.
 * The "send" commands transmits a supplied raw signal the requested number of times.
 *
 * Only the first character of the command is evaluated in this implementation.
 *
 * The "receive" command returns the received IR sequence as a sequence
 * of durations, including a (dummy) trailing silence.  On-periods
 * ("marks", "flashes") are prefixed by "+", while off-periods ("spaces",
 * "gaps") are prefixed by "-". The present version never times out.
 *
 * The \c send command takes the following parameters:
 *
 *       send noSends frequencyHz introLength repeatLength endingLength durations...

 * where
 *
 * * frequencyHz denotes the modulation frequency in Hz
 * (\e not khz, as is normally used in IRremote)
 * * introLength denotes the length of the intro sequence, must be even,
 * * repeatLength denotes the length of the repeat sequence, must be even,
 * * endingLength denotes the length of the ending sequence (normally 0), must be even.
 * * duration... denotes the microsecond durations to send,
 *   starting with the first on-period, ending with a (possibly dummy) trailing silence
 *
 * Semantics: first the intro sequence will be sent once (i.e., the first
 * repeatLength durations) (if non-empty).  Then the repeat sequence will
 * be sent (noSends-1) times, unless the intro sequence was empty, in
 * which case it will be send noSends times.  Finally, the ending
 * sequence will be send once (if non-empty).
 *
 * Weaknesses of the IRremote implementation:
 * * Reception never times out if no IR is seen.
 * * The IRrecv class does its own decoding which is irrelevant for us.
 * * The timeout at the end on a signal reception is not configurable.
 *   For example, a NEC1 type signal will cut after the intro sequence,
 *   and the repeats will be considered independent signals.
 *  In IrSqrutinizer, recognition of repeating signals will therefore not work.
 * The size of the data is platform dependent ("unsigned int", which is 16 bit on AVR boards, 32 bits on 32 bit boards).
