/*
 * IRCommandDispatcher.hpp
 *
 * Library to process IR commands by calling functions specified in a mapping array.
 * Commands can be tagged as blocking or non blocking.
 *
 * To run this example you need to install the "IRremote" or "IRMP" library.
 * Install it under "Tools -> Manage Libraries..." or "Ctrl+Shift+I"
 *
 * The IR library calls a callback function, which executes a non blocking command directly in ISR context!
 * A blocking command is stored and sets a stop flag for an already running blocking function to terminate.
 * The blocking command can in turn be executed by main loop by calling IRDispatcher.checkAndRunSuspendedBlockingCommands().
