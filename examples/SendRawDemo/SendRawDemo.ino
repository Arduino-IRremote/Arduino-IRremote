/*
 * SendRawDemo.cpp - demonstrates sending IR codes with sendRaw
 *
 * This example shows how to send a RAW signal using the IRremote library.
 * The example signal is actually a 32 bit NEC signal.
 * Remote Control button: LGTV Power On/Off.
 * Hex Value: 0x20DF10EF, 32 bits
 *
 * If it is a supported protocol, it is more efficient to use the protocol send function
 * (here sendNEC) to send the signal.

 * NEC address=0xFB0C, command=0x18

 * This is data in byte format.
 * The uint8_t/byte elements contain the number of ticks in 50 us.
 * The uint16_t format contains the (number of ticks * 50) if generated by IRremote,
 * so the uint16_t format has exact the same resolution but requires double space.
 * With the uint16_t format, you are able to modify the timings to meet the standards,
 * e.g. use 560 (instead of 11 * 50) for NEC or use 432 for Panasonic. But in this cases,
 * you better use the timing generation functions e.g. sendNEC() directly.
