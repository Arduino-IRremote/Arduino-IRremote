/*
 * TinySender.cpp
 *
 *  Example for sending FAST or NEC protocol using TinyIR.
 *
 *  NEC protocol codes are sent in standard format with 8bit address and 8 bit command as in SimpleSender example.
 *  Saves 780 bytes program memory and 26 bytes RAM compared to SimpleSender, which does the same, but uses the IRRemote library (and is therefore much more flexible).
 *
 * The FAST protocol is a proprietary modified JVC protocol without address, with parity and with a shorter header.
 *  FAST Protocol characteristics:
 * - Bit timing is like NEC or JVC
 * - The header is shorter, 3156 vs. 12500
 * - No address and 16 bit data, interpreted as 8 bit command and 8 bit inverted command,
 *     leading to a fixed protocol length of (6 + (16 * 3) + 1) * 526 = 55 * 526 = 28930 microseconds or 29 ms.
 * - Repeats are sent as complete frames but in a 50 ms period / with a 21 ms distance.
