Use [a gist](gist.github.com) if the code exceeds 30 lines

**checklist:**
- [] I have **read** the README.md file thoroughly
- [] I have searched existing issues to see if there is anything I have missed.
- [] The latest [release](https://github.com/z3t0/Arduino-IRremote/releases/latest) is used
- [] Any code referenced is provided and if over 30 lines a gist is linked INSTEAD of it being pasted in here
- [] The title of the issue is helpful and relevant
