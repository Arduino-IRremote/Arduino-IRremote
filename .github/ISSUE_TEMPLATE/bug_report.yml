        **Thanks for reporting an issue!**

        **Issues are expected to lead to changes in the repository, like code or documentation improvements or bug fixes.**
        If you have handling problems or questions, consider to post in [Discussions](../discussions) instead.

  - type: input
    id: Board_FQBN
    attributes:
      label: Please specify "FQBN" (Fully Qualified Board Name).
        It is the first line in the compiler output in the Arduino IDE 2.x.
        E.g. "esp32:esp32:featheresp32:FlashFreq=80".
        The FQBN starts with the core name, which is essential for bugfixing.
        For example, at least two prominent cores are available for the Bluepill board, namely STMicroelectronics and STM32duino.
        Without the FQBN we are most likely not able to fix the the issue.
